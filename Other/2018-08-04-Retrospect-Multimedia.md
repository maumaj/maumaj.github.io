In my first year at Whitman College, I decided to keep my focus on academics. I joined a literary magazine, a few on-campus clubs, the yearbook team, and the outdoor program -- but none of these were paid, full-time commitments. At the outset of sophomore year, however, I determined that I would try anything and (nearly) everything. Between working as a Computer Science tutor, an Economics tutor, a Computer Science Lab Aid, a Tech Desk consultant, a Multimedia Intern, a member of the student government communications team, a voting member of our Investment Company, an active member of the Global Awareness House, a Public Relations team member for the literary magazine, and as a full-time student... I think it's fair to say that my plate was quite full.

Among this hodgepodge of positions and responsibilities, I learned the most from my experience as a "Multimedia Intern." Now that's a job title open to wide interpretation, and widely interpret it we did. At the start we focused on graphic design and advertising, mounting a campus-wide cybersecurity awareness campaign. We edited podcasts with audio handed to us, and then conducted interviews to create our own stories.

The bulk of our time went towards supporting a new digital humanities course offered at Whitman. We researched different techniques and software packages, creating copious documentation to assist incoming students. With the aid of GIS systems, we assembled tutorials for the class and explored the surroundings of Walla Walla, WA. Most memorably, we had the opportunity to code and implement "twitterbots" using Twitter's API (something I'd love to explore more here).

Upon reflection, I realize that this internship sparked my interest in data science, analytics, and data visualization. I'd set out to work in economics or finance, but I didn't truly know *why*. Economics and finance encompass fascinating theory and impactful applications, and I can certainly appreciate those fields on their own. But with the spirit of computer science, and especially mathematics -- finding patterns and simplicity in a seemingly chaotic world -- I feel that the potential for growth in economics/finance grows twentyfold.

For me, it's also important to do 'good' with what I'm learning, and do 'good' in my career. I'm not sure where that'll take me, but I do know that I care deeply about the world, care deeply about alleviating poverty, and care deeply about listening to others.

This post has been quite the 'reflection' (fine, rambling stream-of-conciousness mess). So I'll end by making a plan for myself, with the hopes that posting online will motivate me even further. For the most part, I'm using this space to explore different resources, so here are some trailheads that I need to wander down (to be continued):
