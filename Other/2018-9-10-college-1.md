Each year, the US Dept. of Education releases a ['College Scorecard,'](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) compiling data about college admissions, financials, and student results. As a student myself, I have a vested interest in student success -- what factors contribute to students' successful completion of a four-year education?

With this scorecard, I can begin with a high-level exploration of the predictors for graduation rates. Keep in mind, this data corresponds to the colleges themselves rather than individual students; we can't track the chance that a student with a composite ACT score of 32 will graduate, only predict the six-year graduation rate from a college with a median composite ACT score of 32.


```python
#load the tools for investigating the dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from math import *
plt.style.use('bmh')
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
#add plotly for interactive graphs
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly import tools

#set plotly credentials
tools.set_credentials_file(username='XXX', api_key='YYY')
```


```python
#load and read the first 5 n of the college dataset for 2014-2015
college = pd.read_csv('college14_15.csv',low_memory=False)
college.head()
```

We'll start with a general look at the relationship between standardized tests and acceptances. I expect that schools with higher median SAT and ACT scores will have more selective admissions.


```python
#begin exploring -- what are the characteristics of a selective college?
college_trace = go.Scatter(
    x = college['ADM_RATE'] * 100,
    y = college['ACTCMMID'],
    mode = 'markers',
    marker=dict(
        size='6',
        color = college['SATVRMID']+college['SATMTMID']+college['SATWRMID'],
        colorscale='Viridis',
        colorbar=ColorBar(
                title='Med. Composite SAT'
            ),        
        showscale=True
    ),
    text = college['INSTNM']
)

college_layout= go.Layout(
    title= 'College Admit Rate vs. Median Composite ACT Score',
    hovermode= 'closest',
    xaxis= dict(
        title= 'Admit Rate (%)',
        ticklen= 5,
        zeroline= False,
        gridwidth= 2,
    ),
    yaxis=dict(
        title= 'Median Composite ACT',
        ticklen= 5,
        gridwidth= 2,
    ),
    showlegend= False
)

#assemble figure
data=[college_trace]
fig = go.Figure(data=data,layout=college_layout)

#plot data w/ plotly
py.iplot(fig, filename='basic-scatter')
```

As we could reasonably assume, schools with lower acceptance rates have class cohorts with higher ACT scores. Our use of the college scorecard seems to be working out thus far. But let's shift focus to our primary area of interest -- can we use these same test scores to predict graduation rates?


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=2,figsize=(15,15))

ax1 = plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.scatter(college['SATVRMID'], college['C150_4'], color='turquoise', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of SAT Critical Reading Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,2, sharex=ax1)
plt.scatter(college['SATMTMID'], college['C150_4'], color='cornflowerblue', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of SAT Math Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,3, sharex=ax1)
plt.scatter(college['SATWRMID'], college['C150_4'], color='cornflowerblue', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of SAT Writing Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.scatter(college['SAT_AVG'], college['C150_4'], color='turquoise', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Average Overall SAT Score')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.show();
```

Somewhat predictably (and perhaps unfortunantely), the higher a student's SAT score, the more likely they are to graduate from a 4-year institution within 4 years. There is an exponential relationship between, say, *s* as the SAT score and *r* as the graduation rate, approximately giving $ r = \sqrt{s} $. ACT scores will probably have a similar relationship with graduation rate, but it doesn't hurt to check.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=2,figsize=(15,15))

plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.scatter(college['ACTENMID'], college['C150_4'], color='turquoise', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of ACT English Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.scatter(college['ACTMTMID'], college['C150_4'], color='cornflowerblue', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of ACT Math Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,3)
plt.scatter(college['ACTWRMID'], college['C150_4'], color='cornflowerblue', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint of ACT Writing Scores')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
plt.scatter(college['ACTCMMID'], college['C150_4'], color='turquoise', alpha=0.5,)
plt.xlabel('Midpoint Composite ACT Score')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')

plt.show();
```

While SAT and ACT scores can provide insights on the 2015 cohort, it'll take following the money to learn more about what factors bolster graduation rates. Tuition and fees seem like an obvious place to start. After looking at the distribution of said fees (out-of-state vs in-state), we'll examine their relationship with graduation rates.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,10))
plt.hist(college['TUITIONFEE_OUT'].dropna(),50,alpha=0.5)
plt.hist(college['TUITIONFEE_IN'].dropna(),50,alpha=0.5,color='violet')
plt.xlabel('Total 2015 Tuition, USD')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend(labels=['Out of State','In State']);
```

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(college['TUITIONFEE_OUT'], college['C150_4'], color='maroon', alpha=0.8,)
plt.scatter(college['TUITIONFEE_IN'], college['C150_4'], color='blueviolet', alpha=0.3)
plt.xlabel('Total Tuition and Fees (2015 USD)')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')
plt.legend(labels=['Out of State','In State'])
plt.show();
```

Fair enough. In-state tuition has a slightly positive relationship with graduation rates, but there's no striking trend. For out-of-state tuition, there is a clear increase in the graduation rate with an increase in tuition and fees.

Perhaps a greater monetary investment in education leads more students to finish out their education, or perhaps students with more monetary resources also have more access to academic support. To dig deeper, we'd need to look at individual students' backgrounds; for now we can use the trend as a predictive and correlative, but not inferential, relationship.

Can we follow the money trail further, and examine its relationship with the graduation rate? Sure, there's a weak exponential relationship between the money spent on each student and graduation rates.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(clean_college['INEXPFTE'],clean_college['C150_4'],alpha=.2, color='seagreen')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')
plt.xlabel('Instructional Expenses per Full-Time Student');
```

We'll visualize a few more predictors of six-year graduation rates before building a predictive model. Let's take a look at:

- Average Faculty Salary
- Percent of Faculty that are Full Time
- Average Family Income of Dependent Students in 2015 USD
- Average Family Income of Independent Students in 2015 USD
- Average Age of Entry
- Share of Married Students
- Share of Female Students
- Share of Dependent Students
- Share of Veteran Students
- Share of First-Generation College Students


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2,figsize=(15,15))

plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.scatter(college['AVGFACSAL'],college['C150_4'],alpha=.2, color='skyblue')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')
plt.xlabel('Average Faculty Salary')

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.scatter(college['PFTFAC'],college['C150_4'],alpha=.2, color='teal')
plt.ylabel('Graduation Rate (6yrs)')
plt.xlabel('Percent of Faculty that are Full Time');
```

Aside from the predictors of 'Share of Female Students' and 'Avg Family Income of Independent Students.' From here, we'll explore if we can use these predictors to accurately find the six-year graduation rates. But that's another investigation for another day.
