There's something about self-motivated, independent learning that excites me like nothing else. Sure, it takes a good kick of motivation, and (when done right) some serious organizational chops. With the staggering amount of blogs, videos, articles, tutorials, and so on, I'm not surprised when Wired reports a dismal 10% completion rate in MOOC courses. The multitude of resources can be a double-edged sword. But when you're truly able to really dig into a subject, explore all the rabbit holes, and glimpse another part of the world -- that experience stays with you. Sure, you're benefiting from hundreds of researchers and educators, but after all that digging, knowledge feels like it's truly yours.

Still, the classroom setting represents an invaluable element of education. I'm a rising junior at Whitman College, a small liberal arts school in southeastern Washington. While tempted by the quality of the UC system and intrigued by East Coast universities, I chose Whitman for its small class sizes, engaged faculty, and sharp students. Upon arrival, I fell in love with a quantitative blend of Computer Science, Economics, and Mathematics. Although I do enjoy the clarity that numbers can provide, I am equally excited by the creative potential within each field. There's so much more to design, innovate, and learn beyond a college campus' bubble.

And that brings me to this blog. A personal journal more than anything else, writing here will allow me to explore programming, finance, data science, economics, and communication (and whatever else sparks the imagination). I hope passersby will find this project valuable -- and ideally, a way to kick-start their own exploration.
