title: "Adventures in ISL (Pt. 1): Exploratory Data Analysis"

Although I'm excited to share tutorials and completed projects, I mostly intend this blog to be a space for journaling and exploration. While I've gained some knowledge in machine learning techniques and experience with R, it's time to bring the two skills together.

I've been reading through the popular *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. The authors have generously provided the [text](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html) online. As I move through it, I'll be working through some of the exercises and projects here. We start with some simple data analysis, as found in chapter two.

The first task is to explore a dataset with statistics on college attendance, fees, and student outcomes. Let's dig in.


```R
#reading in the college data, selecting the index
college <- read.csv('College.csv')
rownames(college) <- college[,1]
college <- college[,-1]
```


```R
#find descriptive statistics of each p (variable) amongst the n datapoints
summary(college)
```

```R
#investigate total cost of attendance vs. graduation rate
college$Total.Cost = college$Outstate + college$Room.Board + college$Books + college$Personal

#find line of best fit w/ linear regression
lm(college$Grad.Rate ~ college$Total.Cost)
```



    Call:
    lm(formula = college$Grad.Rate ~ college$Total.Cost)

    Coefficients:
           (Intercept)  college$Total.Cost  
             31.599944            0.002029  




```R
#correlation coefficient between cost of attendance and graduation rate
cor(college$Grad.Rate,college$Total.Cost)
```


0.55229142243859


Ok. So there's some positive correlation between the total cost of attending a college and its graduation rate, but nothing shockingly close to one. From this data alone, one might presume that a higher investment in an education provides a compelling reason to finish said schooling. But that's just the tip of the iceberg -- stopping there would be irresponsible. Let's finish out our exploration and plot what we've found.


```R
#plot total cost of attendance vs. graduation rate w/ regression line and its equation
plot(college$Total.Cost, college$Grad.Rate, col=c('violet'), main="Total Cost of Attendance vs.
Graduation Rate")
abline(lm(college$Grad.Rate ~ college$Total.Cost), col=c('maroon'))
legend(18000,20,"y = 31.599944 + 0.002029x", bg='pink',adj=0.05)
```

```R
# see if we can any pairs of variables with a surprisingly greater correlation by extending our search
college$Private = as.integer(college$Private)
college$Elite = as.integer(college$Elite)
collegeCor <- cor(college,use="pairwise.complete.obs")

#limit our search to weak or greater correlations (|R^2| > 30)
collegeCor[abs(collegeCor) < 0.3] = 'N/A'
collegeCor
```

Ok. We should limit our search. Let's investigate the predictors for graduation rates...


```R
#view significant correlation coefficients between graduation rates and other p
collegeCor[,"Grad.Rate"]
```

Wonderful! We'll continue this investigation in the future, building a model with predictors of graduation rates and different colleges.
