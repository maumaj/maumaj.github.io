*Above: a word cloud with common words scraped from front pages of over
2000 college's home pages. We can tell what colleges are advertising and
making easily accessible for students -- they're promoting popular programs
like business management, highlighting their tech-related programs, publicizing
financial aid, and soliciting questions.*

*Above, based on a sentiment analysis of college front pages, we see a
slight lean towards positive sentiments. Although they focus on including
information for reference, colleges have a vested interest in making their
product fresh and exciting*

In today's fast-paced, information-driven society, a college degree is a valuable
possession on the job market. Since 1970, the US has seen enrollment more than double.

Unfortunately —  though unsurprisingly — tuition and fees have done the same, even when adjusted
for inflation. Funding cuts and growing endowments have contributed to this steep increase, alongside
a change in college's marketing strategies (a higher sticker price means better 'deals').

But despite this massive increase in tuition, graduation rates have remained roughly the same. It's becoming
more and more pertinent to ask "is the cost of higher education justified? is it worth it?"; but even before
broaching those topics, we've got to consider whether students are succeeding (graduating) from college.

Based on college structure, tuition, and student demographics, can we predict the graduation rate of a given college?
Can we find what correlates with higher graduation rates?

The first question, concerning predictions, can be addressed with non-parametric machine learning regression techniques.
