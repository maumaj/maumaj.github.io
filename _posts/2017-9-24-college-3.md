*Above: a word cloud with common words scraped from front pages of over
2000 college's home pages. We can tell what colleges are advertising and
making easily accessible for students -- they're promoting popular programs
like business management, highlighting their tech-related programs, publicizing
financial aid, and soliciting questions.*


*Above, based on a sentiment analysis of college front pages, we see a
slight lean towards positive sentiments. Although they focus on including
information for reference, colleges have a vested interest in making their
product fresh and exciting*

In today's fast-paced, information-driven society, a college degree is a valuable
possession on the job market. Since 1970, the US has seen enrollment more than double.

Unfortunately —  though unsurprisingly — tuition and fees have done the same, even when adjusted
for inflation. Funding cuts and growing endowments have contributed to this steep increase, alongside
a change in college's marketing strategies (a higher sticker price means better 'deals').

But despite this massive increase in tuition, graduation rates have remained roughly the same. It's becoming
more and more pertinent to ask "is the cost of higher education justified? is it worth it?"; but even before
broaching those topics, we've got to consider whether students are succeeding (graduating) from college.

Based on college structure, tuition, and student demographics, can we predict the graduation rate of a given college?
Can we find what correlates with higher graduation rates?

For this preliminary study, we'll take a look at data from the US Department of Education. Each year, they publish a
'College Scorecard', storing mostly quantitative data on nearly 2500 institutions of higher education. With every college
you can find information on factors like 'highest degree awarded','faculty salary','average SAT score','percent of students
who are women', and — most importantly — 'four year graduation rate'. You can access that data yourself [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).

Our first question, concerning predictions, can be addressed with non-parametric machine learning regression techniques. Yes,
that's a mouthful, but follow along with some examples. We first turn to *decision trees* -- these regressors, more often used for classification, identify areas of high variance among the factors we're inputting and creates 'splits' with which to analyze new data. For example, if we're looking at biomes, the decision tree algorithm may identify that some have a high plant density and some a lower plant density, and find more clear divisions down each of those paths. Think of the tree like a game of 20 questions, where different answers lead to a different value down the road. (learn more [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-trees-in-machine-learning-641b9c4e8052))

When testing a model we like to build it ('fit it') on a certain portion of the data, and test it on another -- that helps us see how well the model would behave on new data. Quantitatively we use the metrics of R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). R-Squared tells us how much the model captures deviations from the mean (in this case, the mean graduation rate). MSE, as the name implies, looks at the difference between each predicted and actual graduation rate, squares the value, and takes the average across all graduation rates.

So let's take a look! How well does the decision tree fare?

With an R-squared of 0.852715 and MSE of 0.083714, our model has strong predictive power. However, we can see that predicted values fall into certain buckets, with under a dozen 'graduation rates' — obviously graduation rates fall within a range, and don't present as a few discrete values. I'd hypothesize that this is the result of using a decision tree, as it's difficult for a range of quantitative values to fall out from a 'game of 20 questions.'

Let's try Support Vector Regression (SVR) instead. This method ---

While our R-squared has decreased to 0.779528, our MSE has also decreased. It's clear that we face a tradeoff when selecting a machine learning model. Not bad! We now know that college graduation rates aren't completely arbitrary -- they can be predicted based on the factors within the US Dept. of Education's 'College Scorecard'. But while we could implement a 'guessing game' widget to predict your college's graduation rate, that would be neither helpful nor very interesting.

Instead, let's take a more explanatory approach to modeling college graduation rates. Linear regression will give us not only predictions, but associate weights with each input variable. We'll take those weights as measures of importance, telling us which input variables do the best job of predicting graduation rates.

Great! A list of the most important variables. Unfortunately, some of the variables in the College Scorecard include repayment rates, salaries post-graduation, and percent of individuals employed. We'll handpick several variables that come into play *before* graduation. Take a look --

Ok, that's a clearer picture. And we could probably predict some of these predictors.
