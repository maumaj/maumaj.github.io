There are three basic ways of training and working with the CNN.

Train from Scratch (most challenging)
This is the most challenging. You may need hundreds of thousands of labeled images
for training. The training can also take a very long time- The example below took a
modern PC about 6 hours to train.


• Transfer learning.
In transfer learning, you begin with a network that has been trained (presumably for
related tasks). For example, we might download AlexNet from the internet, which has
already been pretrained with thousands of images. We might then focus training on
“Trucks versus Cars” from that. This would then just be fine tuning your parameters
instead of starting from scratch.
Use a pre-trained CNN. For a new task, fine-tune the network weights.
