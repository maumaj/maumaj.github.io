<p> Hi! I'm Tyler Maule, a rising junior at Whitman College in Walla
Walla, Washington. In the classroom, I've been exploring the intersections
between programming, economics, finance, and mathematics. Beyond academics,
I spend much of my time hiking, reading, cooking, doodling, writing, and
traveling. </p>
<div class="blurb_backdrop">
<p> I created this website to develop, deepen, and write about my passions.
  Check out my blog to see what I'm up to now, my resum√© to see what I've done,
  and contact me to talk about the future. Cheers!
</p>
