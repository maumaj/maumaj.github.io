<p > Hi! I'm Tyler Maule, a rising junior at Whitman College in Walla
Walla, Washington. In the classroom, I've been exploring the intersections
between programming, economics, finance, and mathematics. Beyond academics,
I spend much of my time hiking, cooking, doodling, and
traveling. </p>
<div class="blurb_backdrop">
  <p> I created this website to develop, deepen, and write about my passions.
  Check out my blog (under construction) to see what I'm up to now,
  my resum√© to see what I've done, and contact me to talk about the future.
  Suggest some [new books to read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34648546-tyler-maule)
  . Cheers!
